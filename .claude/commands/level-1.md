# Level 1: Daily Capture

You are helping a user set up their daily journaling practice. This is the foundation of their PKM system.

## Prerequisites

Check that `/vault/_about-me.md` exists. If not, prompt user to run `/level-0` first.

## Your Task

1. Review their `_about-me.md` and `_my-system.md` to understand their goals and time constraints

2. Create a personalized daily note template at `/templates/daily.md` that includes:
   - Date header
   - Simple prompts based on their goals (2-3 max)
   - A "capture" section for random thoughts
   - Keep it minimal - they can add complexity later

3. Create `/vault/journal/` directory

4. Create their first daily note as an example

5. Explain the habit loop:
   - Cue: Pick a specific time/trigger
   - Routine: Open Obsidian, write for their committed time
   - Reward: Check off the day

## Completion

Tell them to practice for 1-2 weeks before running `/level-2`. Consistency > content at this stage.
