# obsidian-workbench

A cloneable, step-by-step Obsidian vault + Claude Code workflow that guides you through building a personal knowledge management (PKM) system and daily journaling practice week by week, level by level.

**You don't "install" a system—you earn it through small, consistent actions that compound.**

## What is this?

obsidian-workbench is not another template you download and forget. It's a guided practice that grows with you:

- **Week by week**: Each level introduces one new habit or system component
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, add layers only when you're ready
- **Claude Code powered**: AI-assisted workflows help you build and customize your system
- **Cloneable**: Fork this repo and make it yours

## Philosophy

Most PKM systems fail because they're too complex from day one. obsidian-workbench takes a different approach:

1. **Start with one thing**: Daily journaling
2. **Build consistency first**: Habits before features
3. **Earn complexity**: New tools unlock as previous habits solidify
4. **Compound over time**: Small daily actions create massive long-term value

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the vault in Obsidian
3. Start with Level 1
4. Follow the weekly guides
5. Let your system grow with you

## Structure

```
/levels          # Progressive guides, one per level
/templates       # Obsidian templates that unlock as you progress
/workflows       # Claude Code workflows for each level
/vault           # Your working Obsidian vault
```
